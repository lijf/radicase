<p>There are two ways to improve signal to noise, increase signal or decrease noise.

<p>DISCLAIMER. I'm not a lawyer, and I don't work or live in the US, but from my understanding medicolegal issues can be quite complicated over there, so PLEASE DON'T CITE the information you find here as authorative (well, actually this goes for everyone). I don't know if you get off the hook citing an article or book but PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK ALL REFERENCES provided, they are for your convenience, but I rely on people's good will that they are correct.

<p>I want this to be a beautiful and curated collection, which is easy to access and filled with only useful information. I prefer a lower number of higher quality cases than the opposite (a larger number of subpar entries - this mostly adds to noise). But what defines a good case is of course subjective so there are only three groundrules, great images (including whole stacks of images), good discussions and relevant references. 

<p>Personally I like references to books I have in my apartment or at our department, but if you use other books please cite them, maybe I get some good ideas of what to add to my library...
References to articles are of course excellent, I work at a university hospital and have access to subscriptions of most major journals, but maybe this is not the case for all readers, so the bigger the better, I guess. (eg Radiology, Radiographics, 
Also, if you can find the article in Mendeley \footnote{If you like collecting articles but haven't tried Mendeley I suggest you check it out (www.mendeley.com), they have a great program for storing your pdfs, good integration to word and bibtex and an interesting social network thing where you can connect with people reading what you read and share articles} and/or pubmed please add these accession numbers as well. Also, if you read a case and take the time to look for the references in Pubmed or Mendeley maybe you can send feedback to the author with the accession numbers in case they are not already there.

<p>To improve quality and give praise there is a feedback icon at the bottom of each page {pratbubbla}, with three options of how to share your opinions, which are not mutually exclusive. Choosing 'author' means the author of the page will get an email with your feedback, 'public' means the feedback will be added to the very same page for all to read (thus enabling a sort of discussion) and 'curator' sends me an email with the feedback.

<p>When you add a case you have the option of keeping it private but the default is that everything added to the site is shared with other users. It is probably obvious but do remember to ANONYMIZE ALL PATIENT RELATED INFORMATION \footnote{}. If I see a case which I don't think is suitable for the open collection I will flag it 'private' and send the author an email explaining my reasons. I will not remove cases from private collections, unless information stored therein is illegal to keep in databases.

<p>You can write up your cases in any language you like. As an extension to the DISCLAIMER at the top I can only double-check information in swedish, english and spanish (I got help from a friend with the chinese translation). I have used the determination 'case' when talking about the pages of the site, but of course an expression like 'didactic unit' might be better, you can of course tell your story however you like. Maybe you prefer to do a presentation on a specific diagnosis or group of diagnoses and adding images from several different patients to the same narrative.

<p>As I guess you have noticed this is an invitation only site, but any member can invite anyone she or he likes. This is another measure to try to decrease noise.

<p>Finally, this is a hobby of mine, I built the site because it's something I hope it can be useful during my radiology residency and I wanted to learn ruby on rails, it's is free to use and I expect it to continue to be so. However, if you like it and would like to buy me a beer next time you are in Uppsala, Sweden, I gladly accept and can also recommend a few places - or maybe we both will be in Chicago come end of November one of these years.  Anyway, you can drop me a line at johannes.finnsson at gmail.com or tweet me (lijf).
